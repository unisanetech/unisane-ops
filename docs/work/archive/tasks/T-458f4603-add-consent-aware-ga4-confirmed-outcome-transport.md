# Task: Add consent-aware GA4 confirmed outcome transport

## Changelog

- `2026-09-12`: Synchronized Task state `complete` from Skopos.

## Goal

Add consent-aware GA4 confirmed outcome transport

## Acceptance

- GA4 uses browser analytics identity and analytics consent, preserves confirmed event identity/time, validates allowlisted payloads and records transport acknowledgement without claiming report ingestion.

## Non-Goals

- None declared.

## Constraints

- None declared.

## Admission And Workflow

- Workflow: `strict`
- Selected risk/detail: `high-impact` / `detailed`
- Recommended risk/detail: `standard` / `standard`
- Selection source: `explicit-override`
- Reason: The work changes multiple paths, durable guidance, configuration, or a normal coordinated surface.
- Reason: The caller explicitly selected high-impact; Skopos recommended standard and kept both values visible.

## Owned Paths

- `docs/standards/13-unisane-ops-product-architecture-baseline.md`
- `packages/web-runtime`

## Ownership Expansions

- None recorded.

## Steps

- [x] **Record Task risk and detail before editing** (implementation, complete) — Confirm whether Task risk is light, standard, or high-impact. Keep the active Task current, use a Plan only for multi-Task direction, add a Decision for durable choices, and add or update a Finding for structural gaps.
- [x] **Review the current pattern in unisane-ops** (implementation, complete) — Use the compact references to confirm the current scope, command surface, and docs entrypoints before editing code.
- [x] **Implement the smallest scoped change** (implementation, complete) — Carry out "Add consent-aware GA4 confirmed outcome transport" inside the resolved scope before widening impact to adjacent areas.
- [x] **Sync docs and instruction surfaces if touched** (docs, complete) — Keep docs, instruction mirrors, and generated project knowledge aligned with the implementation.

## Actions And Guards

- No Action or Guard is selected.

## Evidence And Readiness

- GA4 uses browser analytics identity and analytics consent, preserves confirmed event identity/time, validates allowlisted payloads and records transport acknowledgement without claiming report ingestion. (closure, agent-observation)

## Memory Obligations

- [complete] standard: The declared Task scope owns canonical standard Memory at docs/standards/13-unisane-ops-product-architecture-baseline.md; review and synchronize it if project truth changes. (target: `docs/standards/13-unisane-ops-product-architecture-baseline.md`); resolution: memory-updated
