# Task: Run approved local immutable package channel with producer configuration restoration

## Changelog

- `2026-09-07`: Synchronized Task state `complete` from Skopos.

## Goal

Run approved local immutable package channel with producer configuration restoration

## Acceptance

- Local snapshot artifacts build and install through localhost registry with exact versions; producer source and original configuration preserved, no external publication.

## Non-Goals

- None declared.

## Constraints

- None declared.

## Admission And Workflow

- Workflow: `tracked`
- Selected risk/detail: `standard` / `standard`
- Recommended risk/detail: `standard` / `standard`
- Selection source: `explicit-override`
- Reason: The work changes multiple paths, durable guidance, configuration, or a normal coordinated surface.

## Owned Paths

- `.npmrc`
- `package.json`
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml`

## Ownership Expansions

- None recorded.

## Steps

- [x] **Record Task risk and detail before editing** (implementation, complete) — Confirm whether Task risk is light, standard, or high-impact. Keep the active Task current, use a Plan only for multi-Task direction, add a Decision for durable choices, and add or update a Finding for structural gaps.
- [x] **Review the current pattern in unisane-ops** (implementation, complete) — Use the compact references to confirm the current scope, command surface, and docs entrypoints before editing code.
- [x] **Implement the smallest scoped change** (implementation, complete) — Carry out "Run approved local immutable package channel with producer configuration restoration" inside the resolved scope before widening impact to adjacent areas.
- [x] **Sync docs and instruction surfaces if touched** (docs, complete) — Keep docs, instruction mirrors, and generated project knowledge aligned with the implementation.

## Actions And Guards

- No Action or Guard is selected.

## Evidence And Readiness

- Local snapshot artifacts build and install through localhost registry with exact versions; producer source and original configuration preserved, no external publication. (closure, agent-observation)

## Memory Obligations

- No durable Memory obligation is inferred.

## Portable Task State

This machine-readable block is the durable source used to rebuild local Skopos state.
